GitMC brings the familiar git workflow to Minecraft. It initializes a real git repository inside your world's save directory using [JGit](https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/), so the resulting repo is fully interoperable with stock `git` on the command line — `git log`, `git diff`, branches, merges, pushes, and pulls all work the way you'd expect.

## Features

### Available now

- **`/git init`** — initialize a git repository at the root of the currently
  loaded world's save directory. The `.git` folder is created alongside
  `level.dat`, so every part of the save (region files, player data,
  datapacks, the lot) becomes committable. A default `.gitignore` is
  written covering `session.lock`, `level.dat_old`, `logs/`, and
  `crash-reports/` (skipped if you already have one).
- **`/git status`** — three-section chat output: *changes to be committed*
  (staged), *changes not staged*, and *untracked files*. Sections that
  don't apply are omitted; if the tree is clean, you just get
  *"Working tree clean."*.
- **`/git add <path>`** — stage files matching the given JGit pattern.
  `.` adds everything in the world save (respecting `.gitignore`),
  `*` is top-level only, and you can target specific files or
  directories (e.g. `region/`, `playerdata/yourname.dat`).
- **`/git commit [message]`** — commit whatever is currently staged.
  The author and committer are the Minecraft player who ran the
  command; the message defaults to *"Snapshot by &lt;playername&gt;"*
  if you don't pass one.

### Planned

- `gitmc status` — show modified and untracked files inside the world.
- `gitmc add <path>` / `gitmc add .` — stage changes.
- `gitmc commit [-m <msg>]` — snapshot the world state with a message.
- `gitmc log` — list recent commits with player attribution and timestamps.
- `gitmc branch [name]` / `gitmc checkout <branch>` — branch to try risky
  changes, then come back.
- `gitmc revert <commit>` — roll a world back to an earlier snapshot.
- A sensible built-in `.gitignore` for volatile files (e.g. `session.lock`,
  hot-loaded chunk regions).
- A chat-based diff viewer.

If any of those are particularly useful to you, please open an issue —
priority is roughly driven by what people actually want.

## Requirements

| | Minimum | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minecraft | `26.2` | Any `26.x` should work; the build pins `~26.2`. |
| Fabric Loader | `0.19.3` | |
| Fabric API | `0.154.2+26.2` | Match this to your Minecraft version. |
| Java | `25` | Required to *build*. The mod itself runs inside Minecraft's bundled JRE. |

## Installation

### Players

1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) for Minecraft 26.2.
2. Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/polybit/gitmc/releases) jar
   (or [build from source](#build-from-source)).
3. Drop the jar into your `.minecraft/mods/` folder.
4. Launch Minecraft 26.2.
5. Load or create a world, then run `/git init` once to bootstrap a repo
   in that world.

### Server operators

Identical to the player flow, but the jar goes into the server's `mods/`
folder. Run `/git init` once as a server operator (or in the server
console) to bootstrap the repo in the world save directory.

## Usage

```
/git
├── init                  Initialize a git repository in the current world's save directory.
├── status                Show staged, unstaged, and untracked files.
├── add <path>            Stage files matching <path> (`.`, `*`, a directory, or a specific file).
└── commit [message]      Commit whatever is staged, attributing the author to the running player.
```

By default the repo is untracked after `init`. The typical loop is
`status` → `add .` → `commit -m "Placed a creeper farm at spawn"`, but you
can also work in smaller slices (`add region/`, then `commit -m "..."`,
then `add playerdata/`, then `commit -m "..."`). The author is always
the Minecraft player who ran the command — run it as someone else and
the commit is attributed to them.

## Build from source

Requires **Java 25** (or newer) on `PATH` or `JAVA_HOME`. Gradle is vendored
via the wrapper, so you don't need to install it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/polybit/gitmc.git
cd gitmc
./gradlew build            # or .\gradlew.bat on Windows
```

The built jar lands at `build/libs/gitmc-<version>.jar`.

The first build downloads Gradle 9.6.1, Fabric Loom 1.17, and the Minecraft
26.2 jar into `~/.gradle`, so it can take a few minutes. Subsequent builds
are much faster.

### Verifying the build

```sh
./gradlew check
```

Runs Loom's static checks (access wideners, included jars, mod metadata).

### Installing into your live `mods/` folder

`./gradlew installMod` builds the mod and copies the jar straight into the
launcher's `mods/` directory so the next Minecraft launch picks it up —
handy when you're iterating on the mod with the game open on another monitor.

The destination defaults to `%APPDATA%\.minecraft\mods` on Windows. Override
it per-invocation with a Gradle property or environment variable:

```sh
# One-off, this terminal only
./gradlew installMod -Pgitmc.mods.dir=D:/Games/MultiMC/instances/26.2/mods

# Or set once for the shell
export GITMC_MODS_DIR=/path/to/mods     # macOS / Linux
setx GITMC_MODS_DIR D:\Games\...\mods   # Windows
./gradlew installMod
```

### Targeting a different Minecraft version

The Minecraft, Yarn (none, since 26.x is non-obfuscated), Fabric API, and
Fabric Loader versions are all pinned in `gradle.properties`. To build for
a different release, bump those four values together and rerun
`./gradlew build`. The non-obfuscated plugin id
(`net.fabricmc.fabric-loom`) is required for any `26.x` target.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-thing`.
3. Make your change. Run `./gradlew build` locally — it must succeed before
   you open a PR.
4. Open a PR against `main` with a short description of the change and the
   command(s) you added or modified.

If you're working on a sizeable feature, please open an issue first so we
can agree on the shape of the API before you sink time into it.
